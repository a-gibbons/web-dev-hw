**Explain how web browsers function**

Web browsers are software programs that allow users to access and browse the internet. They function by communicating with web servers to retrieve web pages and their associated resources, such as images, videos, and scripts. When a user types in a website address or clicks on a link, the web browser sends a request to the server where the website is hosted, which then sends back a response containing the requested web page and its resources. The browser interprets the code contained in the web page and displays it on the user's screen.


**Define and describe DOM**

The Document Object Model (DOM) is an interface that specifies how a valid document should be accessed and manipulated by logically defining its structure. The DOM represents a document as a tree structure of nodes and objects, which can be accessed and modified using programming languages like JavaScript.


**What is the difference between HTML XML and XHTML?**

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure and content of a web page. XML, on the other hand, is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is readable. XHTML is a combination of the two, which is designed to be more strict than HTML and closer to the rules of XML. XHTML is an XML-based markup language that follows the same rules as XML, which makes it more well-formed and easier to process by machines. In summary, HTML is less strict and more forgiving, XML is more structured and strict, and XHTML is a stricter version of HTML that follows the rules of XML.


**What are the 4 elements your HTML pages need?** 

The !DOCTYPE declaration.
The root element.
The head element.
The body element.


**What is the index.html page for? Where does it go?** 

The index.html page is the default file that is loaded when a user visits a website. It contains the main content of the website, including text, images, and links. The index.html file should be placed at the root level of the website, which is the main folder that contains all the website's files and folders. When a user types in the website's URL or clicks on a link to the website, the web server looks for the index.html file and loads it as the default page.

**Review: What are some of the best naming practices?**

Some of the best naming practices for web development include having a root folder that contains all the necessary elements for a website, avoiding the use of abbreviations, spaces, and special characters, and using lowercase letters for file names whenever possible. It's also important to place the index.html page at the root level and to keep it separate from other folders. Additionally, organizing files into separate folders for pages, images, CSS, and scripts can help keep a website well-organized and easy to navigate.
