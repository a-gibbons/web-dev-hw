    <h2>THE FACTS ARE THESE</h2><br>

    <table style="width:100%;">
        <tr>
            <td class="vert">CLOSEST<br>
                The nearest known black hole, called 1A 06200-00, is 3,000 light-years away.</td>
            <td class="vert"></td>    
            <td>FARTHEST<br>
                The most distant black hole detected, at the center of a galaxy called QSO J0313-1806, is around 13 billion light-years away.</td>
            <td>BIGGEST<br>
                The most massive black hole observed, TON 618, tips the scales at 66 billion times the Sun&#39;s mass.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>SMALLEST<br>
                The lightest-known black hole is only 3.8 times the Sun&#39;s mass. It&#39;s paired up with a star.</td>
            <td>5
                SPAGHETTIFICATION.
                A real term that describes what happens when matter gets too close to a black hole. It&#39;s squeezed horizontally and stretched vertically, resembling a noodle.</td>
            <td>6
                SPIN.
                All black holes spin. The fastest-known&#8211; named GRS 1915+105&#8211;clocks in at over 1,000 rotations per second.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>7
                PARTICLE ACCELERATORS.
                Monster black holes at the centers of galaxies can launch particles to near light speed.</td>
            <td>8
                GRAVITY'S THE SAME.
                If you replaced the Sun with a black hole of the same mass, the solar system would get a lot colder, but the planets would stay in their orbits.</td>
            <td>9
                STAR BOOMS.
                One type of black hole is born when massive stars run out of fuel and explode in supernovae.</td>
            <td>10
                NOT SO RARE.
                Most Milky Way-sized galaxies have monster black holes at their centers. Our is called Sagittarius A* (pronounced ey-star), and it&#39;s 4 million times the Sun&#39;s mass.</td>
