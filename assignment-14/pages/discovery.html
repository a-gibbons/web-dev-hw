          The 35-day mission, known as Endurance 22, faced heavy sea ice, freezing temperatures<br> 
          and extreme weather in its hunt for the iconic vessel, which after being trapped and<br> 
          crushed by ice in 1915, now lies in around 10,000ft of water.<br>
<br>
          Expedition members will be helped in their search by navigational<br> 
          coordinates recorded at the time by Endurance's captain Frank Worsley in his diary.<br>
<br>
          The expedition, organised and funded by The Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust (FMHT),<br> 
          will also study the surrounding sea ice and the impact of climate change on the fragile Antarctic environment.<br>

          One hundred years after Shackleton&#39;s death, Endurance was found at a depth of 3008 metres in the 
          Weddell Sea, within the search area defined by the expedition team before its departure from Cape 
          Town, and approximately four miles south of the position originally recorded by Captain Worsley.

          The team worked from the South African polar research and logistics vessel, S.A. Agulhas II, owned 
          by the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment and under Master, Capt. Knowledge
          Bengu, using Saab&#39;s Sabertooth hybrid underwater search vehicles. The wreck is protected as
          a Historic Site and Monument under the Antarctic Treaty, ensuring that whilst the wreck is being 
          surveyed and filmed it will not be touched or disturbed in any way.
