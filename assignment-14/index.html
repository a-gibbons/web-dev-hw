            Ernest Shackleton was determined to make his mark on exploration history by doing what no man had done before by crossing the entire continent of
            Antarctica on foot from sea to sea through the south pole but when shackleton's journey to the bottom of the earth went south his leadership skills quick thinking and unbelievable bravery turned the expedition from certain doom into one of history's most incredible survival stories.
        </p>    
<br>
        <p>       
            By 1912, news reached Shackleton that Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had officially become the first person to reach the south pole. Shackleton quickly shifted focus to his next idea, traversing antarctica. The goal of this expedition was to travel from shore to shore through the south pole completing the first land crossing of antarctica. To Shackleton, this was the only remaining challenge to be completed at the bottom of the bottom of the world and he was determined to be the one to see it
            through and make history in the process. for this voyage he initially wanted a crew from the royal navy, but this was denied. So instead he went public again and advertised his need for manpower. His advertisement didn't exactly sugarcoat the journey either, quote:
        </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p>
            "Men wanted for hazardous journey, small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful, honor and recognition in case of success."
        </p>

        <p>	
            Surprisingly, his brutal honesty worked and there were so many applicants that Shackleton had to sort through them and find the most promising adventurers. the imperial trans-arctic expedition began in 1914 when Shackleton's ship, Endurance, set sail for the Weddell Sea, while a
            second ship, Aurora, would sail to the other end of the continent and set up camp to receive Shackleton at the end of his trip. but just as Endurance reached Antarctica, things started going wrong almost immediately. just as Shackleton's ship reached the continent, it became stuck in the pack ice that surrounds Antarctica. Shackleton ordered his men to use every tool at their disposal to free the ship and the
            entire crew was busy for days, hacking away with ice picks, pickaxes, and anything remotely sharp from the kitchen, but it was futile, the ice was only growing thicker. Seeing that there was no hope of freeing the ship until spring, he ordered that the ship be turned into a winter camp until the ice melted enough to continue toward mainland Antarctica.
        </p>
        <p>
            As they waited for spring, Endurance gently drifted along with the ice, in which it was frozen, and all the while the crew hunkered down in their cabins through the pitch-black winter. Shackleton understood the importance of high morale in his men, so he kept their spirits high, and he told them to take walks when the moon was brightest. Amateur theater performances were attempted on the deck and holidays were celebrated. they even held races among their sled dogs to stay entertained, just
            as the ice was beginning to warm up and winter's grip on the ship was being loosened, the shifting pressures from melting ice all around squeezed the ship harder than ever before, and harder than it could handle. Up to this point the crew was still holding out hope that they could salvage Endurance, but when the hull started cracking from the new pressure, those hopes were dashed. As water started leaking into the cabins, the crew finally abandoned ship, for amonth or so they made daily trips to the collapsed ship to grab anything useful left behind. 
        </p>
        <p>
            On November 21 1915 Endurance was officially sinking, all 28
            men were now stranded on the ice, separated from the actual coast of
            antarctica with no way to call for help. Knowing supplies were limited and morale was low, Shackleton wasted no time formulating a plan, after some debate, he decided that the best chance was either to march across the drifting ice to Snow Hill Island where some emergency supplies had been left at a shelter, or to Paulet Island where Shackleton himself had left a food depot over a decade earlier. To save on food rations, the weakest sled dogs were shot and sadly, the cat, mrs chippy. The next day the crew started their march pulling supplies and two lifeboats on sleds, but the terrain was so rough that after three whole days of walking, the men had only traveled two miles. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At this rate, their food would long run out before they reached a supply depot at one of the islands, so their only option was to wait on the ice as it drifted in the desired direction. Therefore they set up their tents on the ice and named the spot Ocean Camp. They were actually floating at quite an impressive speed by early december as much as seven miles every day, but a few weeks later when their bearing began to shift away from their destination, Shackleton ordered everyone to prepare for hiking across the ice on foot once again. But the terrain had worsened since their last attempt and now the rising temperatures of summer had softened some of the ice turning the ground into snow or wet sludge, just a few days into this grueling walk Carpenter Harry McNish, whos cat was the one they shot earlier, refused to work, claiming he was no longer under orders since the ship had been lost and he had lost faith in Shackleton over the failed march. In the end Shackleton was able
            to talk some sense into him and keep the crew moving, but the tension remained.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shackleton likely knew that the march was futile but it was crucial for the crew to know that he had tried every option on the ice. By January 1916, the crew had been trudging for over a week, exhausted from the uneven ground, wet boots and diminishing rations, they had only travelled 12 miles. Shackleton called an end to the march saying that<br>
<br>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    "At this rate, it would take us over 300 days to reach the land."<br>
                </blockquote>
<br>
            The place where they gave up their march would be named Patience Camp and it would become their home for the next several months. by
            February, suppliers were running dangerously low and the rest of the sled
            dogs had to be eaten. The group was then sent back to recover some supplies that were left at Ocean Camp as well as the third and final lifeboat, which would soon come in handy. The stable of their
            diet at this point was penguin meat which was easy enough to hunt on the ice nearby. But the lack of vitamins in everyone's diet meant that the group was developing scurvy, with penguin meat so abundant near Patience Camp, the men discussed building a stockpile that could last them months but Shackleton strictly forbade this. That might seem
            illogical at first but his reasoning was twofold. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Firstly, the men were occupied with the hunting keeping their minds busy day by day, but more importantly Shackleton understood the psychological implication of stockpiling food, it means you're not leaving anytime soon or ever and he had to keep the men's hope alive that there was a possibility of returning home. Patience Camp continued to drift unpredictably at one point even reaching the same latitude as Paulet Island, one of their original destinations, but it was 60 miles to the east. 60 miles doesn't sound like much, but Shackleton said it might as well have been 600, because they had no chance of crossing the melting ice against the current to get there. On April the 8th, the ice suddenly cracked through Patience Camp leaving the crew on an even smaller triangular chunk of ice, they had to move on and Shackleton had
            started to narrow down the next options.
        </p>
        <p>
            The men separated into three wooden lifeboats, one led by Shackleton, and the others led by two officers that he selected and they began making their way northward. Progress was slow and dangerous, everyone's clothes were soaked in ice cold sea water and morale was
            sinking with every passing day. So Shackleton finalized his plans and
            announced the next destination, Elephant Island. When the crew made it to Elephant Island, they couldn't approach the coast as it was shockingly surrounded by ice, but they managed to find a small rocky beach on the northern coast to make camp for the night, Some of them hadn't slept
            during the journey which had lasted 80 hours. The next day they found a dry place to stay which they later named Camp Wilde, but Shackleton wasn't planning to simply survive on some remote island for the
            remainder of his days, he was determined to bring his men home. So he immediately got started on the next phase of his seemingly impossible plan. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To put it simply, Elephant Island is a desolate and remote rock, even today, it has a population of zero. There are no native plants and in 1916, the only visitors to the island were seals and penguins, but the few animals were a source of food and the island was a somewhat stable place to wait for rescue, if it would ever come. This was Shackleton's last task to leave the island with a small group, and return with a rescue ship, Shackleton chose five other men to accompany him and they got to work drawing up their plans. Looking at their prospects, the ocean currents
            eliminated the tip of South America as a possible destination, even though it was technically closest. The next inhabited island that could actually be reached by lifeboat was South Georgia Island which
            was a staggering 800 miles away. McNish, the carpenter had rebelled earlier was chosen for the voyage and began modifying the lifeboat. On April 24 1916, this lifeboat was launched with six men and four weeks of provisions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So let's put this in perspective, Shackleton was attempting to sail 800 miles in the roughest ocean on earth in a small open boat, this had never been done before and likely has not been done since, because
            well it's totally insane, but Shackleton had no other choice. Using a sextant the navigator Worsley, would try to get a reading every day by matching the sun to the horizon using complex calculations and nautical maps. But some days this was impossible, as the sun hid behind thick
            clouds or waves that were so intense that Shackleton described them as the largest he'd seen in 26 years at sea. After several days Worsley calculated that the group traveled 238 miles and they started their turn towards South Georgia, if his calculations were off by just half a degree to the south, the group would miss the island and were lost in the southern ocean and would almost certainly die. Their chances were
            minimal, but as Shackleton said<br>
<br>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                "difficulties are just things to overcome, after all."<br>
            </blockquote>
<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            On may the 10th after battling some of the harshest elements known to man, the group arrived at South Georgia. They had achieved the impossible, and it brought them to their physical and mental limits, but their struggles didn't end there. South Georgia was chosen as the destination because of a whaling station on the island which would have
            men, a ship, and the necessary supplies to rescue his men back at Elephant Island. Not to mention Endurance had docked there
            on its way to antarctica and Shackleton were somewhat familiar with the whalers, but Shackleton's group landed on the south side of the island and the whalying outposts were on the northern coast. The lifeboat they'd taken was falling apart and could not handle an additional journey of over 100 miles, two of the men, were quite ill, so the only remaining option was to cross the somewhat narrow island on foot. After a camp was set up and the weather cleared up, the two sick men and another stayed with the boat while Shackleton and two others started the crossing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Crossing South Georgia isn't exactly a walk in the park, when the men hiked up to get a view of the interior they saw cliffs, glaciers, and rocky mountains in all directions. As the men were guessing, their path across these uncharted mountains, they had to continually backtrack as they reached dead ends or cliffs. Normally they'd carve out shallow
            footholds to descend slopes, but at one point they risked it all and slid down a mountainside on a makeshift rope sled. Further crossing the unmapped glaciers presented the risk of falling and crashing at any moment. Shackleton hoped, to march without stopping but the two men
            with him were literally collapsing with exhaustion begging for just a brief rest, and here we see Shackleton's incredible understanding of the mind. He was aware the danger of falling asleep as he wrote in his diary 
            sleep under these conditions mergers into death  but he allowed the men to rest, and they fell asleep immediately. Shackleton woke them up after just five minutes telling them it had been over half an hour the men
            with no reason not to believe him, were convinced they had rested and hiked the remainder of the journey without complaint.
        </p>
        <p>
            After 36 grueling hours, the men's eyes were on their watches with
            anticipation and as expected at exactly 7 a.m., a steam whistle rung out through the island calling the whalers to work and telling the tired sailors that they were close to rescue. Shackleton and his men made their way down to the dock, the same one they had visited 17 months earlier.
            Though unrecognizable at first, the men were welcome and soon after the three men left on the other side of the island were picked up. After two failed attempts, she finally made it back to Elephant Island to rescue the rest of the crew who had been through absolute hell. They were starving, only able to eat the occasional shellfish after the penguin's
            norbert hunted, one of the men had to have his toes amputated and violence was brewing but not one life was lost, despite all odds, Shackleton had succeeded. The crew returned to Europe after almost two years at sea, and having been away for so long, they were unaware that the great war had begun and being of relative unimportance compared to the war, their return went rather unnoticed. The majority of the men were cooked in the list and Shackleton himself was later sent to Murmansk Russia because of his experience in frozen seas. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After the war, Shackleton gathered a crew including some men from Endurance, for another expedition. This time with the goal of circumnavigating Antarctica but this would be his final voyage as Shackleton died of a heart attack in 1922 while in port and none other than South Georgia Island.  His death marked the end of the heroic age of antarctic exploration and the original goal of crossing Antarctica on foot wouldn't be completed for another 50 years. Shackleton was buried on South Georgia Island where to this day a monument stands to remind the world of his incredible story.
