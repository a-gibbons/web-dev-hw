One of the main advantages of using a text editor is that it allows you to create and edit plain text files quickly and efficiently. 
Text editors are lightweight and fast, which means they can be used to edit large files without any lag. 
Additionally, text editors are highly customizable, allowing you to configure them to match your workflow and coding preferences. 
Finally, text editors are often free and open source, meaning you can use them without any cost and contribute to their development if you have the skills and interests. 
However, because they don't support rich content like images or formatting, their use is limited when it comes to more complex information.



Relative URLs are often preferred over absolute URLs because they are shorter and more portable. 
However, it's important to note that absolute URLs contain more information than relative URLs. 
One fundamental limitation of relative URLs is that they can only be used to reference links on the same server as the page that contains them.
