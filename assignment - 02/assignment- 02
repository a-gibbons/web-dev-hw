# Assignment 2

This is the repository for **Assignment 2**

Feel free to use this as an example to practice *markdown*.
1. Use "#"s and a *space* to create a heading. Less is more.
2. Use ** on each side of text to make it **bold**. Just one * on each side makes it *italic*.
3. I'm making a list with numbers and a period. Use a - for a bulleted list.

A space in between lines of text create **Paragraph

Try to experiment with creating both [absolute urls](https://github.com/a-gibbons/web-dev-hw) and [relative urls](./(ReadMe.md))
