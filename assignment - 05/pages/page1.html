            "The poems, ranging from serious to silly, from philosophical to ridiculous, allow the reader or listener
            --the rhyme and rhythm of these nonsensical poems make them perfect for reading aloud-- to discover 
            Silverstein's greatest gift: his ability to understand the fears and wishes and silliness of children" 
            (Silvey, 602).
