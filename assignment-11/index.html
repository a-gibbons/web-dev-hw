        <p>My favorite game when I was little, was Clue. My dad introduced me to the game and said he had never lost a game.<br>
             I wanted to be able to say that as well, so I got the game, and have not lost once.<br>
              I even, beat my dad.</p>

        <p>The game was made by a British musician named Anthony Pratt. The game did originally come with 10 characters, 9 weapons, and 9 rooms.</p>
